# EDA and Birth Weight Prediction using Supervised ML Algorithms
The purpose of this project is to understand the relationship between the birth weight of a newborn baby and 17 different characteristics of their parents.

This repositary contains two Pyhton scripts(one for EDA and one for ML algorithm selection) and an excel file that includes the birth weight dataset.
